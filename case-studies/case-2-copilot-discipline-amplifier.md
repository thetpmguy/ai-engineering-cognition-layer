# Case 2: GitHub Copilot as a Discipline Amplifier

This case study demonstrates how GitHub Copilot was used to accelerate execution **after standards were already defined**.

Copilot was scoped to:
- Test scaffolding
- Logging boilerplate
- Error handling patterns
- Repetitive domain constructs

Architecture and cross-service reasoning remained human-led.

## System design

- Heavy use of templates and examples
- CI gates enforce standards
- Copilot helps engineers meet the bar faster

---

## Key insight

Copilot amplifies discipline.
It does not create it.
